## **My personal information:**

Until now, I didn't expieriensed a lot in IT. I am studying on the second course of [Minck State Linguistic University](https://www.mslu.by/) and of course my base skills are languages. Before starting the course I knew only how to do Microsoft Word, Paint, Power Point, Excel and other primitive computer programs. But I have a great source of memory, and, because of my young age studying quickly.
